    <h1>What is the introduction of math?</h1>
    <p>
        Mathematics is the <span class="highlight">science and study of quality, structure, space, and change</span>. 
        Mathematicians seek out patterns, formulate new conjectures, and establish truth by rigorous deduction 
        from appropriately chosen axioms and definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is debate over whether <i>mathematical objects</i> such as numbers and points exist naturally or are 
        human creations. The mathematician <b>Benjamin Peirce</b> called mathematics “<span class="highlight">the 
        science that draws necessary conclusions</span>.” <b>Albert Einstein</b>, on the other hand, stated that 
        “<span class="highlight">as far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain; and as 
        far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality</span>.”
    </p>

        Today, mathematics is used throughout the world as an essential tool in many fields, including 
        natural science, engineering, medicine, and the social sciences. Applied mathematics, the branch of 
        mathematics concerned with application of <b>mathematical knowledge</b> to other fields, inspires and makes 
        use of new mathematical discoveries and sometimes leads to the development of entirely new disciplines. 
        Mathematicians also engage in pure mathematics, or mathematics for its own sake, <span class="highlight">without 
        having any application in mind</span>, although practical applications for what began as pure mathematics 
        are often discovered later.

    <h1>Introduction to Chemistry</h1>
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">Chemistry</span> is the study of matter and the ways in which different forms of matter 
        combine with each other. <span class="highlight">You study chemistry because it helps you to understand the world 
        around you</span>. Everything you touch or taste or smell is a chemical, and the interactions of these chemicals 
        with each other define our universe. <span class="highlight">Chemistry forms the fundamental basis for biology and 
        medicine</span>. From the structure of proteins and nucleic acids, to the design, synthesis, and manufacture of 
        drugs, chemistry allows you to:

        Chemistry also acts as a major determinant in meeting the human needs for food, 
        <span class="highlight">healthcare products</span>, and also other <span class="highlight">materials</span> 
        aimed at improving life’s quality.
